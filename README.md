Summary: This data analysis covers a study between Lifestyle Habits and Mental Health Disorders that contribute to a participant's overall happiness score. 
Research Goals: Identify if lower mental health diagnosis is correlated to higher exercise, and does sleep impacts the frequency of mental health disorders 
Test: Chi-Square and One-Way Anova --> both p-values above 0.05, indicating that there is no statistical significance, and we fail to reject both null hypotheses 
Future Direction: Understand how social interaction and screen time correlate to the overall happiness scores of participants
